How  we can get newest version ofl ibrarie withouth spending hube amount of tokens?

Currently items service is migrated to DDD even though it 
could be not the best implementation

----------

Migrate error responses to the new spring functionality for them

Key Functionalities to Learn
Path Rewriting & Stripping: Modify the URI before it reaches the downstream service (e.g., removing a version prefix like /v1).

Rate Limiting with Redis: Prevent service abuse by limiting requests based on IP, user ID, or API keys.

Custom Global Filters: Implement cross-cutting concerns like logging execution time, adding correlation IDs, or custom security checks.

Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j): Gracefully handle downstream service failures by returning a "fallback" response instead of a 500 error.

Request/Response Transformation: Dynamically add, remove, or modify headers and body content (e.g., adding a X-Gateway-Auth header).

Query Parameter Routing: Route traffic to different versions of a service based on a version parameter in the URL.

Header-Based Routing: Implement "Canary" or "Blue-Green" deployments by routing users with a specific header (e.g., X-Beta-User: true) to a preview environment.
