 I want to change that logic "        if (!session.isValid(clock.instant())) {
              throw new InvalidTokenException();
          }
  " in validateToken in AuthService class. I don't want to throw exception in that case. The idea is the following - when we validate the token we should return 200 in case the token is
  valid or not! In case of valid the response will as is, in case of not valid token we will just return valid field set to false!

  In case of missing auhtorization header we should return 400 - bad request (with our error response)

  In case of empty authorization header, invalid token format, etc we should return 401

  Change all places where needed - Auth Service, Controller advices, tests, integraiton tests, etc.

After compilation, tests passed, you can assume everything is fine.


You MUST NOT change files outside AUTH PROJECT folder!
