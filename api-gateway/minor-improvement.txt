Change I want to be made:

-------------------------------
I saw code like this:

private final Function<String, Optional<ValidateResponse>> resilientValidator;

    public AuthServiceProxy(...) {
        // Create the reusable "Resilient Pipeline" once during initialization
        this.resilientValidator = Decorators.ofFunction((String token) -> callAuthService(token))
            .withThreadPoolBulkhead(threadPoolBulkhead) // Isolated threads
            .withTimeLimiter(timeLimiter, scheduler)   // Timeout + Interruption
            .withCircuitBreaker(circuitBreaker)        // Failure tracking
            .withRetry(retry)                          // Auto-retry
            .decorate();
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<ValidateResponse> validateToken(String token) {
        try {
            // Simply call the pre-built pipeline
            return resilientValidator.apply(token);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return handleExceptions(e);
        }
    }


I like how everything is configured and you jsut have one line in validateToken, so you don't create all retry, circuitbreaker, etc before the call.|

I would like similar in the DefaultAuthserviceClient.java class
Also start using bulhead in that service. I don't want to hammer auth service with huge amount of requests. For now just add maximum 5 paralel requests (do this change only here, don't touch toher places like caches, etc)
Don't forget that we are using virtual threads and in thte bulkhead you MUST NOT pass system threads pool!


----------------------------------------


Auth service has change a bit - validate endpoint will not return valid: false json in case the token is not valid! Till now it throws exception, but it is not the case anymore!

In case of missing authorization header it will return bad request(400).

Handle these scenarios where needed in api-gateway service (do not touch or check auth service)


---------------------------



-------------------------------
During the implmenetaiotn of the points above: 

- Don't Add any tests!

- Don't do any changes outside the project!

- Don't run any testst!

After you are done, just try to compile the project!
