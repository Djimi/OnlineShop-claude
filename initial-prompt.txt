Start working on plan in "planning/2025-12-31-api-gateway-improvement-PLAN.md".

Don't ask me for any permissions (as I am not watchin you actively).

So I expect that you:
- First create points in the plan file, so we can mark what is done (with green) and what is not in red.

- For now do the work for all points up until 2.3 (including), so 2.4 and on will not be done for now.

- check that everything is compiling, running, etc. Also verify this by building the project, docker image and run e2e tests

- Create another file named "what-is-done.txt" and put what has been done with detailed explanation.
